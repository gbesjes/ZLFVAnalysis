Setup AnalysisSUSY 2.3.36a.

Can't get AnalysisSUSY because you're on a Mac or because you want to hack a package? Use AnalysisBase 2.3.36 and run this:
$ diff -u /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/sw/ASG/AnalysisBase/2.3.36/packages.rc /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/sw/ASG/AnalysisSUSY/2.3.36a/packages.rc | grep ^+ | grep -v ++ | sed s/\+// >> extra_packages.rc

It will make a list of all the tags that are different between AnalysisBase and AnalysisSUSY and add them to an extra_packages.rc file. 

Missing a private build? Put this in $HOME/.rcSetup.conf (with the correct locations):

asgConf={ 'private': { 'asgType': 'private',
               'location': '/Users/gbesjes/bin/AnalysisBase',
               'pattern': '*.*.*'}}

Don't forget to run
root -b -q $ROOTCOREDIR/scripts/load_packages.C
after you run source rcSetup.sh - otherwise you get weird errors.

Running
-------

1) Ensure you have a running cvmfs mount!
2) setupATLAS
3) source rcSetup.sh
4) root -b -q $ROOTCOREDIR/scripts/load_packages.C
5) cafe ZLFVAnalysis/zLFV.config Input: DAOD_HIGG4D2.06315294._000001.pool.root.1 | tee test.log

Errors related to a tau tool missing a selection.xml are likely due to a missing cvmfs mount!
