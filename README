Setup AnalysisSUSY 2.3.36a.

Can't get AnalysisSUSY because you're on a Mac or because you want to hack a package? Use AnalysisBase 2.3.36 and run this:

diff -u /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/sw/ASG/AnalysisBase/2.3.36/packages.rc /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/sw/ASG/AnalysisSUSY/2.3.36a/packages.rc | grep ^+ | grep -v ++ | sed s/\+// >> extra_packages.rc

It will make a list of all the tags that are different between AnalysisBase and AnalysisSUSY and add them to an extra_packages.rc file.
